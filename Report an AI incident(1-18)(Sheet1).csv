On one occasion, the system reported a high AI-generated sign, but later the student was able to provide convincing evidence that the work was his own original work. So, we believe an AI incident happened here. Turnitin should be responsible for this incident. The student was asked to attend a meeting with staff members to clarify the situation. The time and effort of the student and staff were wasted in this case.

I received an automated message with no clear explanation. Since I had used Amazon Pay many times before without issues, this was confusing. I contacted customer support and later spoke to a human representative who said the system had flagged the payment by mistake. After verification, the block was removed and I was able to complete the payment. However, it caused delay and some stress at the time.
I believe this involved an AI or automated decision system because the block happened instantly and was reversed only after manual review."

The boy kept exchanging texts with the bot that kept reassuring him of his decisions, and he eventually ended his life after only informing the AI bot of his next move. AI usage should be restricted to certain ages, and it should be trained to deny or redirect talking about such sensitive matters with children/teenagers.

The email signature, writing style, and the voice on the call closely matched that of the regional manager. However, I quickly noticed that the request did not follow normal approval processes and contained minor factual and typographical errors in relation to some of our internal systems. I verified directly with said manager via MS Teams, who confirmed he had not made the request. We believe the email and voice call were AI-generated to impersonate a known authority figure. The incident was reported internally, and the sender details were blocked. Staff awareness was raised via an organization-wide email. No further contact from the perpetrators has been reported."

Impact: low , confusion and loss of time
Date: 15/11/2024
Reason: AI error, incorrect information

Description:
I recently used ChatGPT for a university assignment to help me write a paper about a recent French legal topic. ChatGPT gave me information that sounded kind of confident, including references to laws and legal reforms. Later, I discovered that some of these laws or reforms did not exist or were described incorrectly.

Because the answer looked good, I used this information in a first draft of my work. During a discussion with my law mentor, they pointed out that some of the legal sources were not real. I then checked the information myself and realized that ChatGPT had created references that sounded plausible but were false.

The mistake was corrected before the final submission, so there was no academic penalty. However, it caused a significant loss of time and made me question how reliable ChatGPT is for specialized and actual informations. "

I used it to get recommendations for restaurants and then used it to book a reservation at that restaurant. The extension notified me of the creation of the reservation and I even received a receipt but the reservation was never created. I ended up going somewhere else as a result. I believe it was through Booking.com? It was the first time I used it because I really like new technology (often bleeding edge cases) I think it was called Trip Planner or close in name.

This was not only fake, but also feeding to the existing Islamophobia, Xenophobia and Racism in Germany, also fearmongering. AI should be used for scientific advancements, not to spread hate and fake information that can be harmful to millions. AI bots would boost these posts to make them more viral.

On this specific day at my workplace, I logged in as usual to the system to record the start of my work shift every day, but the supervisor wasn't seeing the data on his end and said I wasn't coming to work frequently. I tried to explain myself, and as he investigated further, he found out I've been coming to work every day and therefore suggested compensating me for the normal working hours.
